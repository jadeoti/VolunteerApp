                <p>Sometime in 2005, Pastor Poju Oyemade received an inspired thought to establish a first-class educational project targeting public primary schools. This inspired thought later crystallized into Edu-Aid, which represents Covenant Christian Centreâ€™s social response to the falling standards in the quality of education and learning environment available in Nigerian public primary schools today.
                    In this initial phase, Edu-Aid is designed as a community-based educational project targeted at addressing the identified education-related needs in public primary schools in our local community.
